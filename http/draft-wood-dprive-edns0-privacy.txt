Abstract

   This document specifics EDNS(0) "Cache Control" option which allows
   DNS clients and servers (recursive resolvers) to signal each other
   the desired caching behavior of the current request and/or response.
   Specifically, it allows signals that query answers should not be
   globally cached or that some queries should not be served from cache
   at all.

1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) [RFC1035] was designed to transport all
   messages in cleartext.  This provides no privacy, confidentiality, or
   integrity (in the absence of DNSSEC [RFC4033]) for all client queries
   and responses against a network adversary.  [RFC7858] standardizes
   running DNS over (D)TLS to protect data in transit.  TODO DOH
   reference.

   Even if data is protected in transit, the current caching behavior of
   recursive DNS resolvers introduces a side channel for an active
   network adversary to learn queries made by other clients.
   Specifically, in response to a client's query, a recursive resolver
   will fetch the corresponding record by traversing the DNS hierarchy
   and cache it to more efficiently respond to the same query in the
   future.  Returning a cached record is expected to be faster than
   making network requests to fetch it and that timing difference is
   observable by the client making the query.  Because the cache is
   shared by all clients, if a client observes a fast response time for
   a given query it can infer that some other client has already made
   that query in the past.  Malicious clients may exploit this caching
   behavior to use the cache as an oracle for the network activity of
   other clients.

Internet-Draft           EDNS(0) Private Option           September 2018


   In this document, we propose a new EDNS(0) option that allows clients
   to control caching for improved privacy behavior.  We specify
   recursive behavior when processing private queries and caching their
   responses.  Usage of this option SHOULD only be enabled when running
   over a spoofing-resistant transport such as TCP, as recursive
   resolvers may choose to cache responses in per-user caches identified
   by network information such as the source port and IP.

2.  Terminology

   The terms "Requestor" and "Responder" are to be interpreted as
   specified in [RFC6891].

3.  Cache Probe Privacy Attack

   Securing DNS traffic in transit has many benefits.  Minimally, it
   prevents eavesdroppers observing queries and responses in transit.
   However, as this only protects the data channel, other privacy
   attacks remain possible.  In this document, we focus solely on the
   cache probe attack outlined in Section Section 1.  We describe the
   attack in more detail here.

   Let S be a benign client (requestor) using recursive resolver
   (responder) R.  In answering S's queries, R speaks to several
   authoritative servers A1,...,An.  Let RTT(requestor, responder) be a
   function that computes the average RTT for a given query and response
   between requestor and responder.  For example, RTT(R,A1) is the
   average RTT for answering a query sent by R and answered by A1.  Let
   Delay(q, r) be a function that measures the delay in answering
   request q with response r.  Finally, let Adv be a malicious client
   who wishes to learn what queries were asked by S.  Adv proceeds as
   follows.  Assume Adv wants to learn if S queried for q = example.com.
   To do so, Adv requests q from R, yielding response r, and measures d
   = delay(q, r).  Then, Adv sends a random query q' in the same top-
   level domain (e.g., .com), yielding response r', that S is unlikely
   to have requested, and measures d' = delay(q', r').  If |d - d'| ~ 0,
   then Adv concludes q was not requested by S (or someone else).
   Otherwise, Adv concludes that, with some probability q was requested.

   Severity of this attack depends on several factors:

   o  How many clients (stubs) are served by R.

   o  What types of queries are requested by other clients of R.  For
      example, do they require more recursive resolution steps to
      resolve?  If so, this may inflate time required to answer the
      query.

   While learning the existence of a certain query may not always
   constitute a privacy violation, it may for some clients.

3.1.  Recursive Resolver Deployments

   Large-scale recursive resolvers, such as those operated by Quad9,
   Cloudflare, and Google, traditionally deploy several servers behind
   well known anycast IP addresses, such as 8.8.8.8 or 9.9.9.9.  Thus,
   stub queries to such well known resolvers may not be serviced by the
   same logical recursive resolver.  UDP queries and TCP connections may
   be routed to different resolvers based on distance and connection
   cost.  This increases the difficulty of cache probing attacks.
   Recursive resolvers that are not deployed at such large scales are
   more susceptible to this type of attack.

4.  Per-User Cache

   A Per-User cache is an independent local DNS cache keyed to a user
   specific session.  For transports that use TLS this can be a client
   certificate, or for DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)
   [I-D.ietf-doh-dns-over-https], this can be an HTTP based session
   mechanism.  Per-User caches may be aggressively expired prematurely
   to prevent fragmentation.

5.  CACHE-CONTROL Option

   EDNS(0) [RFC6891] specifies a mechanism to include new options in DNS
   messages.  This document specifies a new "CACHE-CONTROL" option for
   both requests and responses.

   0                       8                      16

   |    CACHE-CONTROL Flags     |
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

   The OPTION-CODE for the "CACHE-CONTROL" option is TBD.

   The OPTION-LENGTH for the "CACHE-CONTROL" option is one or more
   octets.

   The CACHE-CONTROL flags are a bitwise OR of the following attributes
   of the first byte.  Unused bits MUST be set to zero.

   The NO-CACHE attribute (0x80).  When present on a request this
   attribute indicates the response information MUST NOT be retreived
   from a cache.  However, the response MAY be stored in a cache and
   reused for a subsequent query that does not contain this attribute.
   When present on a response this attribute is equivalent to the NO-
   STORE attribute.

   The NO-STORE attribute (0x40).  When present, on either a request or
   a response, this attribute indicates that if the response is not
   retrieved from a local cache then it MUST NOT be stored in a local
   cache.  All responses to a query with the NO-STORE attribute MUST
   also include the NO-STORE attribute.

   The SHORT-STORE attribute (0x20).  When present on either a request
   or a response, this attribute indicates that if the response is not
   retrieved from a local cache then it MUST NOT be stored in a local
   cache for more than 60 (TODO) seconds.  All responses to a query with
   the SHORT-STORE attribute MUST also include the SHORT-STORE
   attribute.

   The PRIVATE attribute (0x10).  When present, on either a request or a
   response, this attribute indicates that the response MUST only stored
   to or retrieved from a Per-User local cache Section 4.  If there is
   not a Per-User local cache available the request and response MUST
   both be handled as if both the NO-CACHE and NO-STORE attributes were
   present.  All responses to a query with the PRIVATE attribute MUST
   also include the PRIVATE attribute.

   Queries generated to answer a query, including both intermediate and
   terminal requests, MUST contain at least the attributes of the
   original query.

6.  IANA Considerations

   ((TODO: codepoint for option type))

7.  Security Considerations

   Clients that malicious mark all queries as private may induce
   excessive upstream responder traffic while responding said queries.
   However, as malicious clients may do this today by issuing queries
   for nonsensical or nonexistent domains, this does not introduce a new
   attack vector.

8.  Privacy Considerations

   Selectively sending a private DNS query based on user behavior leaks
   information about user behavior or system policy.  For example, if
   clients only send private queries while in a certain system
   configuration, then presence of a "Private" option indicates, with
   high probability, that the origin user's device is in such a
   configuration.  This could be addressed by marking queries as private
   - at random or unilaterally - such that system configurations are
   indistinguishable under observation of the "Private" option.

Appendix A.  Artificial Delays

   An alternative mechanism to support caching without inducing upstream
   traffic is for responders to "ignore" cached responses and emulate
   fetch delays for queries marked private.  This variation may work as
   follows:

   Responders that receive a query Q with "Private" options MUST do one
   of the following to satisfy Q:

   1.  If response R is not cached, resolve Q using upstream
       authoritative or recursive resolvers.

   2.  If response R is cached, ignore R and attempt to resolve Q using
       upstream authoritative or recursive resolvers.

   3.  If response R is cached, delay sending R to the requestor until
       some time T has passed.  T is a random variable with distribution
       equal to the resolution distribution time of R.

A.1.  Delay Distributions

   T measurement and distribution estimation is critical for masking the
   timing side channel described in Section Section 1.  Both should be
   chosen to maximize requestor utility while minimizing responder
   overhead.  We draw on observations and experiments by [Acs17] in
   deciding these factors.

   Responders SHOULD measure query resolution time T' and use this in
   selecting T's distribution.  There are two recommended delay
   strategies for responders assuming knowledge of T', including:

   1.  Uniform: Delay for some time T* that is selected uniformly at
       random in the range [0, T'], i.e,. with probability distribution
       function Pr[T = t] = 1/T'.

   2.  Geometric: Delay for some time T* that is selected according to a
       geometric distribution, i.e., with probability distribution
       function Pr[T = t] = (1 - t) * t^k, where k is a parameter for
       the distribution.
