1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) [RFC1035] was designed to transport all
   messages in cleartext.  This provides no privacy, confidentiality, or
   integrity (in the absence of DNSSEC [RFC4033]) for all client queries
   and responses against a network adversary.  [RFC7858] standardizes
   running DNS over (D)TLS to protect data in transit.

   Even if data is protected in transit, the current caching behavior of
   recursive DNS resolvers introduces a side channel for an active
   network adversary to learn queries made by other clients.
   Specifically, in response to a client's query, a recursive resolver
   will fetch the corresponding record by traversing the DNS hierarchy
   and cache it to more effieciently respond to the same query in the
   future.  Returning a cached record is expected to be faster than
   making network requests to fetch it and that timing difference is
   observable by the client making the query.  Because the cache is
   shared by all clients, if a client observes a fast response time for
   a given query it can infer that some other client has already made
   that query in the past.  Malicious clients may exploit this caching
   behavior to use the cache as an oracle for the network activity of
   other clients.  Proof of concept code is provided in Appendix A.

   In this document, we propose a new EDNS(0) option that allows clients
   to mark queries as privacy sensitive.  We specify recursive behavior
   when processing private queries and caching their responses.  Usage
   of this option SHOULD only be enabled when running over a secure
   transport such as TLS [RFC7858], as otherwise recursive resolvers or
   other responders are subject to denial-of-service attacks.

2.  Terminology

   The terms "Requestor" and "Responder" are to be interpreted as
   specified in [RFC6891].

3.  Cache Probe Privacy Attack

   Securing DNS traffic in transit via DNS-over-TLS has many benefits.
   Minimally, it prevents eavesdroppers observing queries and responses
   in transit.  However, as this only protects the data channel, other
   privacy attacks remain possible.  In this document, we focus soley on
   the cache probe attack outlined in Section Section 1.  We describe
   the attack in more detail here.

   Let S be a benign client (requestor) using recursive resolver
   (responder) R.  In answering S's queries, R speaks to several
   authoritative servers A1,...,An.  Let RTT(requestor, responder) be a
   function that computes the average RTT for a given query and response
   between requestor and responder.  For example, RTT(R,A1) is the
   average RTT for answering a query sent by R and answered by A1.  Let
   Delay(q, r) be a function that measures the delay in answering
   request q with response r.  Finally, let Adv be a malicious client
   who wishes to learn what queries were asked by S.  Adv proceeds as
   follows.  Assume Adv wants to learn if S queried for q = example.com.
   To do so, Adv requests q from R, yielding response r, and measures d
   = delay(q, r).  Then, Adv sends a random query q' in the same top-
   level domain (e.g., .com), yielding response r', that S is unlikely
   to have requested, and measures d' = delay(q', r').  If |d - d'| ~ 0,
   then Adv concludes q was not requested by S (or someone else).
   Otherwise, Adv concludes that, with some probability q was requested.

   Severity of this attack depends on several factors:

   o  How many clients (stubs) are served by R.

   o  What types of queries are requested by other clients of R.  For
      example, do they require more recursive resolution steps to
      resolve?  If so, this may inflate time required to answer the
      query.

   While learning the existence of a certain query may not always
   constitute a privacy violation, it may for some clients.

4.  "Private" Option

   EDNS(0) [RFC6891] specifies a mechanism to include new options in DNS
   messages.  This document specifies a new "Private" option that allows
   clients to indicate

   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

   The OPTION-CODE for the "Private" option is TBD.

   The OPTION-LENGTH for the "Private" option is one octet.

   The PRIVATE octet MUST be set to 0x01.  Presence of this option
   indicates that a query is private.  Other values MUST NOT be used.
   Responders, such as recursive resolvers, MUST drop the query if
   another value is set, as discussed in Section Section 6.

5.  Requestor Usage and Behavior

   Requestors MAY include a "Private" option for any query deemed
   private or sensitive.  This may include queries for explicitly known-
   to-be private domains or for all domains when operating in a
   "private" mode.  Specific recommendations for when to include this
   option are outside the scope of this document.

6.  Responder Usage and Behavior

   There are (at least) two ways responders can handle responder usage.
   They share a common principle: private queries avoid using the same
   cache as non-private queries.  This has the effect of removing side
   channels from private queries.  The two strategies described here
   work as follows:

   1.  Require responders to use per-client, segmented caches for
       private queries that are flushed when secure connections are torn
       down.

   2.  Require responders to "ignore" cached responses and emulate fetch
       delays for queries (and responses) marked private.

   We describe each approach in more detail below.

6.1.  Segmented Caches

   Responders that receive a query Q without the "Private" options may
   treat it as normal, i.e., by serving a response from cache if

   available.  For a query Q with a "Private" option sent from client S,
   responders MUST do the following:

   o  Index S's private cache using Q, if it exists.  If response R is
      present, serve it to S.

   o  If S's private cache does not exist, attempt to resolve Q as
      normal.  Cache the response in S's private cache.

   When S's connection to R is torn down, S's private cache MUST be
   flushed and memory released.  Responders SHOULD apply whatever per-
   client caching policy is sensible to balance utility amongst shared
   (non-private) and private caches.  Segmented caches introduce more
   memory requirements for resolvers at the cost of improving client
   privacy.

   This approach is only viable when clients connect to resolvers over a
   session-based secure transport such as TLS or DTLS.  Otherwise,
   malicious clients may flood resolvers with private queries and induce
   cache fragmentation.

6.2.  Artificial Delays

   Responders that receive a query Q with "Private" options MUST do one
   of the following to satisfy Q:

   1.  If response R is not cached, resolve Q using upstream
       authoritative or recursive resolvers.

   2.  If response R is cached, ignore R and attempt to resolve Q using
       upstream authoritative or recursive resolvers.

   3.  If response R is cached, delay sending R to the requestor until
       some time T has passed.  T is a random variable with distribution
       equal to the resolution distribution time of R.

6.2.1.  Delay Distributions

   T measurement and distribution estimation is critical for masking the
   timing side channel described in Section Section 1.  Both should be
   chosen to maximize requestor utility while minimizing responder
   overhead.  We draw on observations and experiments by [Acs17] in
   deciding these factors.

   Responders SHOULD measure query resolution time T' and use this in
   selecting T's distribution.  There are two recommended delay
   strategies for responders assuming knowledge of T', including:

   1.  Uniform: Delay for some time T* that is selected uniformly at
       random in the range [0, T'], i.e,. with probability distribution
       function Pr[T = t] = 1/T'.

   2.  Geometric: Delay for some time T* that is selected according to a
       geometric distribution, i.e., with probability distribution
       function Pr[T = t] = (1 - t) * t^k, where k is a parameter for
       the distribution.
