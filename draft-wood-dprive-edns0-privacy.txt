                       TLS Session Ticket Request
                  draft-wood-tls-ticketrequest-latest

Abstract

   TLS session tickets are generated by servers and issued to clients
   for stateless resumption.  Moreover, servers often distribute a
   single ticket to clients.  Clients should only use tickets once,
   especially if tickets are used to protect early application data in
   TLS 1.3 and related protocols.  However, single tickets limit a
   client's ability to perform connection racing, as multiple competing
   connections should not re-use the same ticket more than once.  This
   document describes a mechanism that enables the clients to request
   multiple TLS session tickets from the server so as to enable such
   features.

1.  Introduction

   As per [RFC5077], and as described in [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13], TLS
   servers send clients session tickets at their own discretion in
   NewSessionTicket messages.  In contrast, clients are in complete
   control of how many tickets they may use when establishing future
   connections.  For example, clients may open multiple TLS connections
   to the same server for HTTP, or may race TLS connections across
   different network interfaces.  Thus, since connection concurrency and
   resumption is controlled by clients, a mechanism to request tickets
   on demand is desirable.  In this document, we describe a new TLS
   extension and handshake message that permits clients to request new
   session tickets at will from the server.

2.  Ticket Request Message

   TLS tickets may be requested via a SessionTicketRequest handshake
   message, session_ticket_request(25).  Its structure is shown below.

   struct {
       uint8 ticket_count;
       opaque request_context<0..255>;
       Extension extensions<0..2^16-2>;
   } SessionTicketRequest;

   o  ticket_count: The number of tickets requested from the client.

   o  request_context: An opaque context to be used when generating each
      ticket for the request.  Clients and servers may use this context
      to implement or exchange data to be included in the ticket
      computation.

   o  extensions: A set of extension values for the ticket.  The
      "Extension" format is defined in Section 4.2. of
      [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13].  Clients and servers MUST ignore
      unrecognized extensions.

   Upon receipt of a SessionTicketRequest message, servers MAY reply
   with up to ticket_count NewSessionTicket messages.  Servers may
   choose to limit the number of tickets provided to clients based on
   local or administrative policy.

   SessionTicketRequest MAY be sent in the Client Hello, if desired by
   clients, or after handshake completion.  As any other handshake
   message, these messages MUST be added to handshake transcripts.
